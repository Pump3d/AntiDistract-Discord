# AntiDistract-Discord

--Info--
This basically prevents you from typing or using Discord until a set time so that you can focus on schoolwork and not get distrated by Discord.

--Instructions--
To use, go inside your discord app (or website) and press Windows Key + Shift + I (or Option + Command + I on mac) to open the inspect element. Then, click the console tab at the top. Paste the contents of index.js into the console and edit the "stopTime" variable to the time that you want to continue using discord. Click enter and the code will run.

--Roadmap--
Trying to find and stop further bugs, planning to add an HTML block to block all the elements of the page
